## About Me

I got my PhD degree at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC) under the supervision of Prof. Panlong Yang and Prof. Xiang-Yang Li (ACM/IEEE Fellow). Now, I am in [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://en.nuist.edu.cn/main.psp) (NUIST). My research interests span across mobile/wireless sensing, smart health monitoring, and ubiquitous computing. Researchers are welcome to contact me with E-mail and look forward to our cooperation to make meaningful research contributions!
